        Found object deserialization using ObjectInputStream. Deserializing entire Java objects is
        dangerous because malicious actors can create Java object streams with unintended
        consequences. Ensure that the objects being deserialized are not user-controlled. If this
        must be done, consider using HMACs to sign the data stream to make sure it is not tampered
        with, or consider only transmitting object fields and populating a new object.
