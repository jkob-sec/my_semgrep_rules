  message: >-
    Checks for models that use attr_protected, as use of allowlist instead of denylist
    is better practice.
    Attr_protected was also found to be vulnerable to bypass. The fixed versions of
    Rails are: 3.2.12, 3.1.11, 2.3.17.
    To prevent bypass, use attr_accessible instead.
